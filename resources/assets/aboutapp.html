<p style="text-align: justify;">You can sell or buy used books in your nearby using this app. This app is very easy to use, easy interface lets you navigate easily to different screens in the app. You see list of all book that are available for sale in your nearby on the Home screen. User can scroll all books or simply just search typing “keywords” like Book name, Author name or Publisher name. Book listings contain basic information such as Book’s front cover, book’s name, book’s selling price and book description. Further when you click on any Book listing you will see more information about that Book such as book’s Author name, Publisher, Printed Price of the book, Selling Price of the book, Description by book seller, Book seller account and you also get option to Chat and Call (if book seller has enabled this). </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Users can also explore Books Category wise in your nearby, so that they can find any book in their field which may be interesting to them. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In book details screen you get to know who has listed that book and you can click that to visit seller profile and check what all other books they are selling. You can chat with seller and ask if you want to clarify something. Each user can be uniquely identified by username provided by the app. If you need to report about any user about their false information or misleading information you can talk to “Ask Support” and there you can just mention @username and your report, if we find it, we will suspend that user and report you back about the action. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Currently only used books can be sold, so no matter your book is just 1 day old or a year old it is just a used book for us. The maximum price that you can ask is 60% of the printed price on that book. If any seller ever tricks or misleads by increase printed price in order to increase selling price and we get report about this then that user will be permanently get suspended which means from that phone number he/she could not create new account and all his/her books listing will be removed from the app. Or if user try to SCAM someone or abuse someone over this platform and we get report against it then their account will get suspended. So, it is your job to make this platform clean and safe if you see anything which is false or not right just report it as soon as possible. We try to take action as soon as possible by doing our initial investigation over it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Book seller are supposed to delete listed books when it is sold or not available so that user’s only see books that are available. Please take it seriously because it is important to make this platform really useful and clean. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you go to meet book seller in order to take book make sure you choose correct place and right time because we never know if there is some scammer or anything. So be cautious and just choose known public places and day time, these seems perfect. And Good news is we are working on it, we are developing a feature so that user can request us to ship particular book from given seller to you on the same day. This way your privacy and security will be confirmed Yes, we will charge little fees for this which is obvious.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Make sure to tell your friends, family and college mates about this app so they can try out too. This would be a great contribution to this app from your side.</p>
